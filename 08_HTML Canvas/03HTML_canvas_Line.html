<!--
Canvas Coordinates:
==> The HTML canvas is a two-dimensional grid.
==> The upper-left corner of the canvas has the coordinates (0,0)

Draw a Line:
==> To draw a straight line on a canvas, use the following methods:
		moveTo(x,y) - defines the starting point of the line
		lineTo(x,y) - defines the ending point of the line
		
To actually draw the line, you must use one of the "ink" methods, like stroke().
