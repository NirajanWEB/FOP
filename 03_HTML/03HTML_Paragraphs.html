<!--
Paragraphs:
==> The HTML <p> element defines a paragraph:
-->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>

</body>
</html>

<!--
==> Browsers automatically add some white space (a margin) before and after a paragraph.


==> The browser will remove any extra spaces and extra lines when the page is displayed:
<p>
This paragraph
contains a lot of lines
in the source code,
but the browser 
ignores it.
</p>

<p>
This paragraph
contains         a lot of spaces
in the source         code,
but the        browser 
ignores it.
</p>


Line Breaks:
==> The HTML <br> element defines a line break.
==> Use <br> if you want a line break (a new line) without starting a new paragraph:

<p>This is<br>a paragraph<br>with line breaks.</p>

==> <br> tag is an empty tag, which means that it has no end tag.



==> This poem will display on a single line:
<p>
  My Bonnie lies over the ocean.

  My Bonnie lies over the sea.

  My Bonnie lies over the ocean.

  Oh, bring back my Bonnie to me.
</p>

<pre> Element : 
==> The HTML <pre> element defines preformatted text.
==> The text inside a <pre> element is displayed in a fixed-width font 
(usually Courier), and it preserves both spaces and line breaks:

<pre>
  My Bonnie lies over the ocean.

  My Bonnie lies over the sea.

  My Bonnie lies over the ocean.

  Oh, bring back my Bonnie to me.
</pre>
