<!-- 
HTML Headings:
==> Headings are defined with the <h1> to <h6> tags.
==> <h1> defines the most important heading. <h6> defines the least important heading.
==> Browsers automatically add some white space (a margin) before and after a heading.
-->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<h1>Heading 1</h1>
<h2>Heading 2</h2>
<h3>Heading 3</h3>
<h4>Heading 4</h4>
<h5>Heading 5</h5>
<h6>Heading 6</h6>

</body>
</html>

<!--
==> Use HTML headings for headings only. Don't use headings to make text BIG or bold.


Bigger Headings:
==> Each HTML heading has a default size. 
==> However, you can specify the size for any heading with the style attribute, 
using the CSS font-size property
<h1 style="font-size:60px;">Heading 1</h1>


Horizontal Rules:
==> The <hr> tag defines a thematic break in an HTML page, 
and is most often displayed as a horizontal rule.
==> The <hr> element is used to separate content in an HTML page:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<h1>This is heading 1</h1>
<p>This is some text.</p>
<hr>

<h2>This is heading 2</h2>
<p>This is some other text.</p>
<hr>

<h2>This is heading 2</h2>
<p>This is some other text.</p>

</body>
</html>
